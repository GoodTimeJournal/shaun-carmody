Pitch: Based on the Design Your Life course at Standford, this app helps you figure out which activites bring you enjoyment, energy, and engagement. These clues are the first step you need to take to design your ideal ife. The journal includes an activity log and a reflection log. Activity logs record daily your main activities, and a guage to show how engaged and energized you were. Reflection logs are done once a week to record your trends, insights and suprises as to what activities work and don't work for you.

## Your Grading Rubric Here:

Each role has to fulfill the purpose of demonstrating mastery over the objectives you've been taught. UseÂ [this rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BbdmSMUdzURMo0wcsr4XSKvegDgB28WkK2wnjmORzDo/edit?usp=sharing)Â to help guide your development processes

## Tools and Set Up Suggestions

You are going to be setting up your own projects and as each member of the team fulfills their role your app will come to life. However in the beginning this process can be slow so we recommend you using a Data Mocking site like [https://www.mockaroo.com/](https://www.mockaroo.com/) or a package like [http://marak.github.io/faker.js/](http://marak.github.io/faker.js/) to get things set up properly.

## Git Workflow

The Lambda Standard Git workflow is to be used as your version control for this project. The only difference is that you won't be using "Forks" for development.

Each day a student should have least 1 commit in the morning 1 in the afternoon an 1 at the end of the day for a total of 3 commits. 

Work will be done on your typical 'firstname-lastname' branch. All branches will be merged back into the master branch. Remember to add your Scrum Master or PM as a collaborator on the project.  NO FORKS. Keep it simple.
